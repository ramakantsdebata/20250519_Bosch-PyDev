Task:

    1. Parsing XML Data:
        * Read the provided XML file (data.xml) using ElementTree.
        * Extract the following information from the XML:
                Name of the book.
                Author of the book.
                Publication year of the book.
                Price of the book.
                List of genres the book belongs to (if available).
        * Print the extracted information.

    2. Adding New Book:
        * Create a new book entry with the following details:
                Name: "Python Programming"
                Author: "Guido van Rossum"
                Publication Year: 2022
                Price: $39.99
                Genre: "Programming"
        * Add the new book entry to the existing XML structure.

    3. Writing XML Data:
        * Write the modified XML data back to a new XML file (updated_data.xml).
        * Ensure the XML file maintains the same structure as the original file, with the addition of the new book entry.

Instructions:

    * Use Python's ElementTree module to parse and manipulate XML data.
    * Ensure proper error handling is implemented for file operations and XML parsing.
    * Use meaningful variable names and comments to enhance code readability.
    * Submit both the Python script and the updated XML file (updated_data.xml).
    * Include any additional documentation or explanation as needed in the script.

Note:
Ensure that the provided XML file (data.xml) contains at least one book entry to facilitate the parsing and modification tasks.
