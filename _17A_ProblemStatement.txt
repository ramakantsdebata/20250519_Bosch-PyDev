Task:

    1. Parsing JSON Data:
        * Read the provided JSON file (data.json) using the json module.
        * Extract the following information from the JSON:
                Name of the product.
                Category of the product.
                Price of the product.
                Availability of the product.
        * Print the extracted information.

    2. Adding New Product:
        * Create a new product entry with the following details:
                Name: "Python Programming Book"
                Category: "Books"
                Price: $39.99
                Availability: true
        * Add the new product entry to the existing JSON structure.

    3. Writing JSON Data:
        * Write the modified JSON data back to a new JSON file (updated_data.json).
        * Ensure the JSON file maintains the same structure as the original file, with the addition of the new product entry.

Instructions:

    * Use Python's json module to parse and manipulate JSON data.
    * Ensure proper error handling is implemented for file operations and JSON parsing.
    * Use meaningful variable names and comments to enhance code readability.
    * Submit both the Python script and the updated JSON file (updated_data.json).
    * Include any additional documentation or explanation as needed in the script.

Note:
Ensure that the provided JSON file (data.json) contains at least one product entry to facilitate the parsing and modification tasks.
